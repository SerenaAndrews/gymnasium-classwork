  <h2>The Silencing of A Voice The World Loved</h2>
    <h3>Wikinews has related news: Alan Rickman dies at 69 due to cancer</h3>
      <p>In August 2015, Rickman suffered a minor stroke, which led to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. He concealed the fact that he had terminal cancer from all but his closest confidants.[57] On 14 January 2016, Rickman died in a Brooklyn hospital in New York.[58] Soon after, his fans created a memorial underneath the "Platform 9¾" sign at London King's Cross railway station.[59]</p>
      <p>Tributes from Rickman's co-stars and contemporaries appeared on social media following the announcement; since his cancer was not publicly known, some—like Ralph Fiennes, who "cannot believe he is gone", and Jason Isaacs, who was "sidestepped by the awful news"—expressed their surprise.[51] Harry Potter creator J. K. Rowling called Rickman "a magnificent actor and a wonderful man". Emma Watson wrote, "I feel so lucky to have worked and spent time with such a special man and actor. I'll really miss our conversations." Daniel Radcliffe appreciated his loyalty and support: "I'm pretty sure he came and saw everything I ever did on stage both in Britain and America. He didn't have to do that."[60] Evanna Lynch said it was scary to bump into Rickman in character as Snape, but "he was so kind and generous in the moments he wasn't Snaping about."[61] Rupert Grint said, "even though he has gone I will always hear his voice."[51]</p>
      <p>Kate Winslet, who gave a tearful tribute at the London Film Critics'
Circle Awards, remembered Rickman as warm and generous,[62] noting, "And
that voice! Oh, that voice." Dame Helen Mirren said his voice "could
suggest honey or a hidden stiletto blade."[51] Emma Thompson remembered
"the intransigence which made him the great artist he was—his ineffable
and cynical wit, the clarity with which he saw most things, including me
... I learned a lot from him."[60] Colin Firth told The Hollywood
Reporter that, as an actor, Rickman had been a mentor.[63] John
McTiernan, director of Die Hard, said Rickman was the antithesis of the
villainous roles for which he was most famous on screen.[64] Sir Ian
McKellen wrote, "behind [Rickman's] mournful face, which was just as
beautiful when wracked with mirth, there was a super-active spirit,
questing and achieving, a super-hero, unassuming but deadly
effective."[60] Rickman's family offered their thanks "for the messages
of condolence".[65]</p>
