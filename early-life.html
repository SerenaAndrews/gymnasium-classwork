 <h3>Childhood, Loss &amp; Creativity</h3>

 <p>Rickman was born in West London,to a working-class family, the son of Margaret Doreen Rose (n√©e Bartlett),a housewife,and Bernard William Rickman.Rickman's father was a factory worker, house painter and decorator, and former WWII aircraft fitter.His ancestry was English, Irish and Welsh; his father was Catholic and his mother a Methodist.[11] Rickman's family also included brothers David and Michael, and sister Sheila.</p>

 <p>When he was eight years old, Rickman's father died of lung cancer, leaving his mother to raise him and his three siblings mostly alone. According to Paton, the family was "rehoused by the council and moved to an Acton estate to the west of Wormwood Scrubs Prison, where his mother struggled to bring up four children on her own by working for the Post Office. She married again in 1960, but divorced Rickman's stepfather after three years. "There was one love in her life," Rickman later said of her. Before he met Rima Horton at 19, he stated that his first crush was at 10 years old to a girl named Amanda "at sports day." As a child, he excelled at calligraphy and watercolour painting. Rickman attended Derwentwater Primary School in Acton, a school that followed the Montessori method of education, and then Latymer Upper School in London through the Direct Grant system, where he became involved in drama. After leaving Latymer, he attended Chelsea College of Art and Design and then the Royal College of Art. This education allowed him to work as a graphic designer for the Royal College of Art's in-house magazine, ARK and the Notting Hill Herald, which Rickman considered a more stable occupation than acting. "Drama school wasn't considered the sensible thing to do at 18".</p>

 <p>After graduation, Rickman and several friends opened a graphic design studio called Graphiti, but after three years of successful business, he decided that if he was going to pursue acting professionally, it was now or never. He wrote to request an audition with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), which he attended from 1972 until 1974. While there, he studied Shakespeare and supported himself by working as a dresser for Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Sir Ralph Richardson.</p>
